# add travis ci
Chaperone is an Automation toolkit rooted in DevOps principals for deploying
and configuring a Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) based Hybrid Cloud
Management platform. It is intended to expedite and standardize  "typical"
deployments and configuration of VMware solutions including vSphere/vCenter,
NSX, VIO, vRA, vRO, vROps, vRLI, vRB and others as the toolkit grows.

Chaperone is a work in progress.  We will continue to
add new functionality and products to the Chaperone base.


##Chaperone Overview
The Chaperone toolkit consists of
- [web based interfaces](https://github.com/vmware/chaperone-ui) for configuring and triggering the deployment of VMware solutions
- Ansible roles and modules supporting deployment of those solutions
  - [ansible-role-ansible](https://github.com/vmware/ansible-role-ansible)
  - [ansible-role-assets](https://github.com/vmware/ansible-role-assets)
  - [ansible-role-ovftool](https://github.com/vmware/ansible-role-ovftool)
  - [ansible-module-chaperone](https://github.com/vmware/ansible-module-chaperone)
  - this is a small subset of notable roles and modules.  See [the repo manifest](vmwareorg.xml) for more
- [Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/vmware/ansible-playbooks-chaperone), called by the web interface, to combine sets of roles into useful groupings of features
- Extras
  - [docker-chaperone](https://github.com/vmware/docker-chaperone)

###Current Standard Configurations Supported

The plays are used to configure and deploy one of several standard platforms.
The following are under active development, but are considered fairly complete:

- Chaperone for VIO (Open Stack Integration)
- Chaperone for CNA (Cloud Native Application Platform)
- Chaperone for CMP (Hybrid Cloud Management Platform)

###Setup and Run Chaperone
There are more documents for [setting up](docs/setup.md) and [running](docs/run.md) the Chaperone tools against an appropriate SDDC environment.

###User Interfaces
There are two interfaces with which users of Chaperone
interact:

- chaperone-admin-ui (e.g., 'http://chaperone-admin-ui.corp.local')
- chaperone-ui (e.g., 'http://chaperone-ui.corp.local')

*Note the use of internal domains in the URLs above. This is common where
developers or users do not have rights to create new domains in their DNS
servers, and thus make use of locally defined domains. More on that in the
[setup documentation](docs/setup.md).*

####Using the Chaperone Admin UI
The admin UI (chaperone-admin-ui) is an interface that allows one to
select from a list of SDDC features they would like to deploy, and basic
ambient environment information, such as DNS servers, NTP servers, etc. Once
entered into the various "Prepare" menu forms, clicking 'Save' saves the
configuration as a 'codified design.' Basically, that means the information
is saved in a YAML file as a set of parameters or, more commonly Ansible
variables.

Once the chaperone-admin-ui "Prepare" menu forms are complete and saved, the
next step is clicking on the "Install" menu and thereafter "Saving the Configuration."
That is a button on the "Install" menu that generates the second web interface,
the chaperone-ui site.

####Using the Chaperone UI
The chaperone-ui site is the site used to configure the SDDC installations.
The process is the same as chaperone-admin-ui, wherein the user fills out the
"Prepare" forms and saves them. Thereafter, the "Install" menu provides buttons for
the various tasks that must be done to complete the SDDC install. To perform
the various installations and configurations, Chaperone generally runs Ansible
plays as a result of clicking on one of the Install menu buttons. The plays
configure and deploy the environment, pursuant to the saved "Prepare" values.

##Developer's Guide
###Prerequisites
The assumption Chaperone makes for developers is not something one would propose is
light, but not out of the norm for many. We assume reasonable competence in the
following:

-  VMware technologies
-  [Google Repo](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/)
-  [git](https://git-scm.com/)
-  [gerrit](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/install-quick.html)
-  [Python](https://www.python.org)
-  [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com)

###Contributing
Committers (those with rights to merge code) will also need credentials to our Gerrit
server. For the time being, this is an internal process at VMware as all committers
are currently at VMware.

With that said, the Chaperone team welcomes contributions from the community. If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our contributor license agreement (CLA), our bot will update the issue when you open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our [FAQ](https://cla.vmware.com/faq).

###Getting the code
[Instructions to download](docs/setup.md), install and deploy the Chaperone UI
tools and underlying Ansible plays, Python modules and other required code
bases are [here](docs/setup.md)
